        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          By “right approach”, I mean how traditional of a tiramisu recipe I
          wanted to share. (In case you are not familiar with it, Tiramisu is a
          popular Italian dessert made with lady fingers (or spongecake),
          coffee, liqueur, and mascarpone cheese topped with chocolate powder).
          Should I make the lady fingers from scratch? Does it matter? And more
          importantly, do I make it with raw eggs?

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
          <li>8 ounce container mascarpone cheese,room temperature</li>
          <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
          <li>1 1/2 cups cold espresso</li>
          <li>
            3 Tablespoons coffee flavored liqueur ,optional (Kahlua or DaVinci
            brands)
          </li>
          <li>1 package Lady Fingers</li>
          <li>Cocoa powder for dusting the top</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add whipping cream to a mixing bowl and beat on medium speed with
            electric mixers (or use a stand mixer). Slowly add sugar and vanilla
            and continue to beat until stiff peaks. Add mascarpone cheese and
            fold in until combined. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add coffee and liqueur to a shallow bowl. Dip the lady fingers in
            the coffee (Don't soak them--just quickly dip them on both sides to
            get them wet) and lay them in a single layer on the bottom of an
            8x8'' or similar size pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Smooth half of the mascarpone mixture over the top. Add another
            layer of dipped lady fingers. Smooth remaining mascarpone cream over
            the top.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dust cocoa powder generously over the top (I use a fine mesh
            strainer to do this). Refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours or up to
            overnight before serving.
          </li>
        </ol>
