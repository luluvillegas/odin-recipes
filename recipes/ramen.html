<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  Take the usual ramen up a notch with this quick homemade ramen. Fresh veggies
  and herbs make this extra delicious, healthy, and cozy!
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
  <li>3 teaspoons grated ginger</li>
  <li>4 teaspoons grated garlic</li>
  <li>4 cups broth (I used chicken, but vegetable would also work)</li>
  <li>4 cups water</li>
  <li>1 ounce dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
  <li>2 packages instant ramen (noodles only!)</li>
  <li>1/2 cup chopped scallions or chives</li>
  <li>2 cup chopped kale</li>
  <li>1 cups shredded carrots</li>
  <li>Sriracha to taste</li>
  <li>crunchy golden panko crumbs for topping</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over medium low heat. Add the garlic
    and ginger; stir fry for 2 minutes or until soft and fragrant.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the broth and the water. Bring to a simmer; add the mushrooms and simmer
    for 10 minutes or until the mushrooms have softened and the broth is
    flavorful.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the instant noodles to the hot liquid and simmer for an additional 5
    minutes or until the noodles have softened. Add the scallions and stir to
    combine.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove from heat, stir in the kale and carrots, and top with crunchy panko
    crumbs (see notes) and a soft-boiled egg (optional). Season with chili oil,
    hot sauce, sesame oil, and/or soy sauce and salt to taste.
  </li>
</ol>
