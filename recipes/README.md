First Odin Project project designed to have a main file woriking as a directory of recipes with links to other pages within the project each containing one recipe.

Each recipe consists of a title, an image, a description, a list of ingridients and steps to follow.
With those elements I learned how to handle the following HTML elements: headings, images, ordered lists, unordered lists and paragraphs.
