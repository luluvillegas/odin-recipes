<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  By “right approach”, I mean how traditional of a tiramisu recipe I wanted to
  share. (In case you are not familiar with it, Tiramisu is a popular Italian
  dessert made with lady fingers (or spongecake), coffee, liqueur, and
  mascarpone cheese topped with chocolate powder). Should I make the lady
  fingers from scratch? Does it matter? And more importantly, do I make it with
  raw eggs?
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
  <li>8 ounce container mascarpone cheese,room temperature</li>
  <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  <li>1 1/2 cups cold espresso</li>
  <li>
    3 Tablespoons coffee flavored liqueur ,optional (Kahlua or DaVinci brands)
  </li>
  <li>1 package Lady Fingers</li>
  <li>Cocoa powder for dusting the top</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Add whipping cream to a mixing bowl and beat on medium speed with electric
    mixers (or use a stand mixer). Slowly add sugar and vanilla and continue to
    beat until stiff peaks. Add mascarpone cheese and fold in until combined.
    Set aside.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add coffee and liqueur to a shallow bowl. Dip the lady fingers in the coffee
    (Don't soak them--just quickly dip them on both sides to get them wet) and
    lay them in a single layer on the bottom of an 8x8'' or similar size pan.
  </li>
  <li>
    Smooth half of the mascarpone mixture over the top. Add another layer of
    dipped lady fingers. Smooth remaining mascarpone cream over the top.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dust cocoa powder generously over the top (I use a fine mesh strainer to do
    this). Refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours or up to overnight before serving.
  </li>
</ol>
